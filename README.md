## Understanding the Indicators

The Quotex Zigzag strategy relies on three key indicators:

-   **Zigzag Indicator:** This indicator helps you identify potential
    trend reversals by connecting consecutive highs and lows.
-   **Bears Power:** This indicator measures the strength of the bears
    in the market, indicating potential downward trends.
-   **Awesome Oscillator:** This indicator helps you spot momentum
    shifts and potential trading opportunities.

## Setting Up the Indicators

## Executing the Strategy

Once the indicators are set up, here\'s how to execute the Quotex Zigzag
strategy:
